What is .NET
    Managed code 
Code runs in a special runtime env. 
This env handles low level things automatically
Programming langs(many)
C#
Visual basic 
F#
C++, Java, Python 
Interoperability
More than one language can go in one project
Cross platform
Windows, Mac, Linux,etc…
Getting started with .NET
Pick an implementation 
We use .NET core 3.1 
Install .NET Core SDK
To compile and run C#/.NET
Want a good dev. Env. 
Linux-style command line(like bash)
Win: Git Bash/ Git for Windows
Nothing for macs to do
Version control  (Git)
IDE
We use Visual Studio and VS Code 
Right now
Install .NET Core SDK, Git for Windows, VS Code

Terminal commands
pwd, cd, -h, 
Something like $mkdir -v tells you what is happening when you are doing things.
In this example, it would explain that a directory was made
Made a revature directory in the desktop and the user directory
Not sure which one is better 
Seems like he told us to make the directory in the user directory but i want to do the desktop one

For vs code, change settings based on what you want it to look like



Study .NET maybe and definitely do some C# reading up on before the exam 

Terminal commands 
So far 
Dotnet
Git
ls
Cd
Newish
cd <dir>
ls <dir>
mkdir <dir>
Rm
Remove
Rm -r
Recursively delete directory
Delete a directory with its contents
mv <path1> <path2>
Remove or rename
touch <path>
Create an empty file
pwd
Print working directory
Echo <something>
Prints something
Works with variables or contents of files
.. 
Parent directory
.
Current directory 
Ex- “explorer .” on windows opens file explorer to current folder
Absolute paths
Start with /
Same no matter current folder


Relative paths 
Dont start with /
variables , $
filename34 = myfile.text
touch $filename34
Anytime a dollar sign there is a variable referenced. The above example created a var then created an empty file called that var 
Helpful with things like configuration 
PATH
Finds path 
echo $PATH 
Prints long path
