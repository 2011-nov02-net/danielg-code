What is .NET
    Managed code 
    Code runs in a special runtime env. 
        This env handles low level things automatically
    Programming langs(many)
    C#
    Visual basic 
    F#
    C++, Java, Python 
    Interoperability
        More than one language can go in one project
    Cross platform
        Windows, Mac, Linux,etc…
    Getting started with .NET
        Pick an implementation 
        We use .NET core 3.1 
        Install .NET Core SDK
            To compile and run C#/.NET
        Want a good dev. Env. 
            Linux-style command line(like bash)
            Win: Git Bash/ Git for Windows
                Nothing for macs to do
            Version control  (Git)
        IDE
            We use Visual Studio and VS Code 
        Right now
            Install .NET Core SDK, Git for Windows, VS Code

Terminal commands
    pwd, cd, -h, 
    Something like $mkdir -v tells you what is happening when you are doing things.
        In this example, it would explain that a directory was made
    Made a revature directory in the desktop and the user directory
        Not sure which one is better 
        Seems like he told us to make the directory in the user directory but i want to do the desktop one

For vs code, change settings based on what you want it to look like



Study .NET maybe and definitely do some C# reading up on before the exam 

Terminal commands 
    So far 
        Dotnet
        Git
        ls
        Cd
    Newish
        cd <dir>
        ls <dir>
        mkdir <dir>
        Rm
            Remove
        Rm -r
            Recursively delete directory
            Delete a directory with its contents
        mv <path1> <path2>
            Remove or rename
        touch <path>
            Create an empty file
        pwd
            Print working directory
        Echo <something>
            Prints something
            Works with variables or contents of files
        .. 
            Parent directory
        .
            Current directory 
            Ex- “explorer .” on windows opens file explorer to current folder
        Absolute paths
            Start with /
            Same no matter current folder


        Relative paths 
            Dont start with /
        variables , $
            var = "myfile.text"
            touch $var
            echo $var
            Anytime a dollar sign there is a variable referenced. The above example created a var then created an empty file called that var 
            Helpful with things like configuration 
        PATH
            Finds path 
            echo $PATH 
                Prints long path

AFTER LUNCH 11/3 (2nd day)
In console application projects, (created with dotnet new) runtime looks for Main method

projects contain classes
    classes are blueprints for objects 
classes contains members e.g. methods
    method is sequence of statements run one after the other
    it can have inputs and outputs

variables in C# with types 
    type of variable is set when the variable is created. cant be changed after 

types  
    whole numbers
        int- 4 bytes, max = 2 billion
        short- 2 bytes 
        byte - 1 byte
        long - 8 bytes. use if numbers could be larger than 2 billion pos or negative


    fractional numbers  
        double- 8 bytes. use this most of the time with non whole
        float- 4 bytes. less precise than double 
        decimal- 16 bytes. 

    for true/false
        bool

    for text   
        char
        string
    
    
in c#, every type inherits type object
    this allows you to do things like compare or check if equal or call .toString()
    exception of null, null is the default value for reference type variables 

literal value
    one that you type direcctly on the screen. typing the right syntax to get a value of that kind
    int j = 0
    int i=1
    Console.Write("#");
